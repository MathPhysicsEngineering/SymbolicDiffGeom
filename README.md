# SymbolicDiffGeom

A Python library for symbolic differential geometry computations and visualizations.

## Features

- Chart definitions and manifold constructions
- Symbolic computation of geometric objects (metrics, connections, etc.)
- Vector field operations and flow computations
- Advanced visualization capabilities:
  - Surface plotting with coordinate grids
  - Vector field visualization with arrows
  - Flow and geodesic visualization
  - Support for both matplotlib and Open3D backends

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathPhysicsEngineering/SymbolicDiffGeom.git
cd SymbolicDiffGeom
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies

- sympy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- open3d (optional, for advanced 3D visualization)

## Examples

See the `examples` directory for demonstrations, including:

- `sphere.py`: Comprehensive demonstration of SÂ² with vector fields, flows, and geodesics
- More examples coming soon...
