# Symbolic Differential Geometry

A Python library for symbolic differential geometry computations and visualizations. This project provides tools for working with manifolds, charts, vector fields, connections, and more.

## Features

- Chart definitions and transitions
- Metric computations
- Levi-Civita connections
- Vector fields and flows
- Geodesics and parallel transport
- Curvature analysis (Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, scalar curvature)
- Advanced 3D visualizations using matplotlib and Open3D

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains demonstration scripts:
- `sphere.py`: Comprehensive demonstration using SÂ² (2-sphere)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install sympy numpy matplotlib
# Optional for advanced 3D visualization:
pip install open3d
```

## Usage

See the examples directory for detailed usage demonstrations.
